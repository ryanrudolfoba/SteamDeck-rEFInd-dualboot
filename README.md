# Steam Deck - Installing rEFInd for Dual Boot Between SteamOS and Windows


## About

This repository contains the instructions and scripts on how to install [rEFInd - a graphical boot manager.](https://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/)

This will mostly benefit Steam Deck users who have setup a dual boot and wants to have a graphical way to select which OS to boot from.
> **NOTE**\
> If you are going to use this script for a video tutorial, PLEASE reference on your video where you got the script! This will make the support process easier!


## Disclaimer

1. Do this at your own risk!
2. This is for educational and research purposes only!


## But Why Create Another rEFInd Script?!? What's Different?
> **NOTE**\
> This was inspired from the rEFInd script available [here.](https://github.com/jlobue10/SteamDeck_rEFInd)

1. Re-wrote the script and removed unneeded components (3rd party systemd scripts / powershell scripts / EasyUEFI).
2. All-in-One script - install, disable / re-enable, uninstall!
3. Simplified config file so it is easy to read, understand and modify.
4. Doesn't rely on pacman repositories - uses the [official rEFInd ISO](http://sourceforge.net/projects/refind/files/0.13.3.1/refind-cd-0.13.3.1.zip/download) image.
5. Doesn't use hardcoded menu entries - this allows Windows on microSD / external SSD to get detected automatically!
6. misc - Added a cool Matrix Morpheus wallpaper, custom icon for Windows, SteamOS and Batocera.

## !!! WARNING - WARNING - WARNING !!!
> **WARNING!**\
> Please carefully read the items below!
1. The script has been thoroughly tested on a fresh SteamOS and Windows install.
2. If your SteamOS has prior traces of rEFInd or scripts / systemd services related to rEFInd, it is suggested to uninstall / remove those first before proceeding.
3. If your Windows install has scripts or programs related to rEFInd / EasyUEFI, it is suggested to uninstall / remove those first before proceeding.

This is a complete rewrite and it doesn't rely on systemd services /  3rd party apps. I don't know what the behavior will be if those are present in the system. Remove them first before using this script!

## Prerequisites for SteamOS and Windows
**Prerequisites for SteamOS**
1. No prior traces of rEFInd or scripts / systemd services related to rEFInd.
2. deck account should have a blank password, or change the password to "deck" (without the quotes).

**Prerequisites for Windows**
> **NOTE**\
> This applies to Windows installed on the internal SSD / microSD / external SSD.
1. No scripts / scheduled tasks related to rEFInd or EasyEUFI.
2. APU / GPU drivers has been installed and screen orientation set to Landscape.
3. Configure Unbranded Boot. This is to minimize the graphical glitches when booting Windows.
    * Go to Control Panel > Programs and Features > Turn Windows Features On or Off.
    * Expand "Device Lockdown", and then put a check mark on "Unbranded Boot"
    * Open command prompt with admin privileges and enter the commands to disable the boot graphics animation-\
        bcdedit.exe -set {globalsettings} bootuxdisabled on\
        bcdedit.exe -set {bootmgr} noerrordisplay on

## Using the Script
> **NOTE - please read carefully below**
> 1. Make sure you fully read and understand the disclaimer, warnings and pre-requisites!
> 2. The script will create a directory called ~/1rEFInd-tools with scripts to enable / disable Windows EFI and to uninstall rEFInd. Do not delete this folder!

> **IMPORTANT**\
> Once the install is completed, do not change the password for the deck account! Leave it as "deck" (without quotes).\
> This password is also used by the post install scripts located in ~/1rEFInd-tools

Using the script is fairly easy -

1. Open a konsole terminal.
2. Clone the github repo. \
   cd ~/ \
   git clone https://github.com/ryanrudolfoba/SteamDeck-rEFInd-dualboot
   
3. Execute the script! \
   cd ~/SteamDeck-rEFInd-dualboot \
   chmod +x install-rEFInd.sh \
   ./install-rEFInd.sh

5. Reboot the Steam Deck. rEFInd is installed and you should see a GUI to select which OS to boot from! Use the DPAD / trackpad and press A to confirm your choice.

## FAQ / Troubleshooting
Read this for your Common Questions and Answers!

### Q0. Why did you rename / move the Windows EFI file?
EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi â€” Many EFI implementations use it as a fallback boot loader in addition to or instead of EFI/BOOT/bootarch.efi. In fact, some give it such a high precedence that you can't boot anything that's not given this name! [Taken from the official rEFInd documentation.](https://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/installing.html#naming)

### Q0. How do I check that the ISO is not tampered?

Use a hash file calculator. Verify that the hash matches -\
MD5 - 4e5bc6cf04b9263bd0555960f27c10c4\
SHA1 - 2be1a0db421b56e15cf4a14e1c3fbf6a0198f687\
SHA256 - 2c33e5316216dfc8f9cc0c0af3aaa8213f4ff0fb24a380673a7ba21a64ab7a33\
SHA384 - a9ecd691474cfe5132b60022d002d1ed62a592b76aab9f31ad7ce8eec8d38bdfbe835624bfc61ee4a66c8b1c91297353\
